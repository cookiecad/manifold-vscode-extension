# Manifold VS Code Extension

This extension brings the [Manifold](https://github.com/elalish/manifold) geometry library to Visual Studio Code, allowing you to generate, visualize, and animate manifold 3D meshes programmatically. Right from your editor.

## What is Manifold?

[Manifold](https://github.com/elalish/manifold) is a high-performance library for creating and manipulating manifold triangle meshes. Manifold meshes represent solid objects and are essential for CAD, 3D printing, and advanced modeling workflows. The library guarantees robust mesh operations, supports mesh Booleans, smoothing, and arbitrary vertex properties, and is available for C++, TypeScript/JavaScript, and Python.

## Features

- **3D Model Visualization:** Instantly preview 3D meshes generated by your code in an interactive viewer.
- **Animation Support:** Visualize and scrub through mesh animations and transformations.
- **Live Editing:** See changes reflected in real time as you edit your code.

## How It Works

The extension provides a custom viewer for `.mfc` and `.manifoldcad` files, opening a webview panel that renders your 3D models and animations. The webview is built with React and Vite, and leverages the Manifold WASM bindings for mesh generation.

## Development

1. Clone this repository and run `pnpm install` in the root directory.
2. Now build the manifold library and copy the `manifold.js` and `manifold.wasm` files into the `src/webview/src/wasm/` directory.
3. Build the webview by navigating to `src/webview/` and running:
  ```sh
  pnpm install
  pnpm build
  ```
4. Build the extension:
  ```sh
  pnpm compile
  ```
5. Launch the extension in a VS Code Extension Development Host.
A `launch.json` configuration is provided, so inside VS Code, open the Debug panel, select "Launch Extension", and hit the green play button.
A new VS Code window will open with the extension loaded.

6. Or: build the .vsix package for distribution:
  ```sh
  npx vsce package
  ```

## Usage

1. Open or create a `.mfc` file in VS Code.
2. Run the `Manifold: Open 3D Viewer` command from the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P).
3. Edit your code and see the results update live in the viewer.
