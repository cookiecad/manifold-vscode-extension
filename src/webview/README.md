# Manifold VS Code Extension – Webview

This directory contains the **webview** component for the [Manifold VS Code extension](https://github.com/Loosetooth/manifold-vscode-extension). The webview is responsible for visualizing 3D models and animations generated programmatically using the [Manifold library](https://github.com/elalish/manifold).

## What is Manifold?

[Manifold](https://github.com/elalish/manifold) is a high-performance geometry library for creating and manipulating manifold triangle meshes. A manifold mesh represents a solid object, which is essential for applications in manufacturing, CAD, 3D printing, and structural analysis. Manifold guarantees robust, reliable mesh operations and supports advanced features like mesh Booleans, smoothing, and arbitrary vertex properties.

## Purpose of the Webview

The webview provides an interactive 3D viewer and animation bar within VS Code, allowing users to:

- **Visualize** the 3D meshes and models generated by their code using the Manifold library.
- **Preview animations** and transformations applied to models.
- **Interact** with models directly in the editor, making it easier to iterate on geometry and see results in real time.

This component is built with modern web technologies (TypeScript, React, Vite) and leverages WebAssembly (WASM) bindings to run Manifold's mesh operations efficiently in the browser context.

## Directory Structure

- `src/` – React components, main app logic, and utilities for rendering and interaction.
- `wasm/` – WASM bindings and helper scripts for running Manifold in the browser.
- `public/` – Static assets (icons, images) used by the webview.
- `index.html` – Entry point for the webview UI.

## Development

To develop or modify the webview:

1. Build manifold and copy the `manifold.js` and `manifold.wasm` files into the `wasm/` directory.
2. Install dependencies:
	```sh
	pnpm install
	```
3. Build the webview:
	```sh
	pnpm build
	```
4. The output will be placed in the `media/` directory for use by the VS Code extension.
